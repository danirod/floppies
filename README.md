## Contributing

- avatars/: contains the avatars using a spritesheet. Under construction.
- gear/expressions/: contains face expressions, this is at the moment kinda difficult to grasp, be careful
- gear/tag: this is what you're probably looking for, these are the floppy tags, image size should be either 18x12 or 36x24. The bigger it is, the more defined it will be. It should be possible to do a 72x48 too, but this is not tested and not guaranteed to work.
- gear/textures/: overlays on top of the color. keep the black border for reference, also make sure that they overlap.

Previews: good idea, if you want to add them, make them similar to the ones you find in the directory, so that they look nice in the widget.

## Configuration

Use StreamAvatar's palette editor to add extra floppy colors.

To place the gears, it might be necessary to tweak the X:Y offset, zoom and flip settings to make it look nice.
